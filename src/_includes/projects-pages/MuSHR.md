Inspired by MuSHR, we have designed AirOU Race Cars (ARC) with multiple cameras, LiDARS and built-in IMUs. We have built a team of ARC with 1/10 th scale of real race cars,. Our missaion is to mimic connected vehicles navigating in our smart Mini-City.

ARC hs been used for both educational and research purposes. We have implemented different algorithms on ARC such as Visual SLAM, LiDAR SLAM, Autonomous navigation and object detection and tracking.
