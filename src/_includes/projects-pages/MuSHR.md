# ARC Pro:
We have end-to-end designed and built 10 cars, called ArcPro, which features with RGB-D camera and 2D LiDAR. Our car is equipped with Intel NUC processor and is powered by batteries.
ArcPro cars are used for research and education purposes in the area of robotics, computer vision, autonomous driving and navigation, mapping and perception.

# AirOU Race Cars (ARC):
Inspired by MuSHR, we have designed AirOU Race Cars (ARC) with multiple cameras, LiDARS and built-in IMUs. We have built a team of ARC with 1/10 th scale of real race cars,. Our missaion is to mimic connected vehicles navigating in our smart Mini-City.

ARC hs been used for both educational and research purposes. We have implemented different algorithms on ARC such as SLAM, Autonomous navigation and object detection and tracking.
