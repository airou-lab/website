      We present a Similarity-based Incremental Learning Algorithm
      (SILA) [1] for pedestrian motion prediction with the ability of
      improving the learned model over the time as data is obtained
      incrementally.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep the model size efficient, the motion primitives learned
      from the new data are compared with the previously known ones,
      and similar motion primitives are fused while novel motion
      primitives are added to the model.
    </p>
    <p>
      SimFuse is a similarity-based model fusion algorithm for
      improving the prediction accuracy which enables autonomous
      agents to incrementally update their knowledge by communicating
      with other vehicles (V2V) or by infrastructures (V2I).
      This is where we propose the use of a multi-camera visual SLAM
      method, capable of gauging depth through machine learning.

      By merging the maps created from each camera, effectively
      creating a multi-camera system, one could hope to remedy
      complications found in single camera systems, such as
      environmental conditions, like the affect of direct sunlight or other
      obscuring weather conditions.
