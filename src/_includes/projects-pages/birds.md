With more advances in computer vision, studying animal behavior is now becoming easier with the help of animal classification and better detection and tracking algorithms. In this project, we set up an aviary of 15 sparrow birds in partnership with a Biology lab within The University of Oklahoma to try to understand behavior of the Sparrows over long spans of time. In AirLab, we are currently creating and implementing software to detect the different birds Using Mask RCNN combined with a Background Subtraction, then generating key features of the birds to be able to identify them in a 3D-plane to then generate point clouds to track them and be able to view the birds in mulitple different views, also known as Multi-View (5 camera angles in our project).

Pictured below is an example of our detection Algorithm(Mask RCNN + Background Subtraction) 
Note: Detection increased to 15% after addition of Background Detection
