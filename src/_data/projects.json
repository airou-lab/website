We look forward to transferring this software from our assembled MUSHr racecar to future larger projects. Using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) on a simulation of the racecar and its surroundings, we plan on later implementing this software onto the physical car and testing it in the physical world. <br> Pictured on the right is our first assembled and operational MUSHr racecar. <br> Our next step is to implement a simulation using SLAM that allows the vehicle to gather data using the LiDAR and stereo camera installed on-board for accurate and consistent localization. Our goals is for our car to physically showcase fully autonomous navigation.",

The ARCPro also includes full overhaul - Updated chassis, upgraded processor (i7 Intel NUC with 32GB RAM), and an upgraded Lidar (X4-Pro YDLIDAR).",
